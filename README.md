# **EDA Assignment: Road Traffic Accident Dataset**

Welcome to the **EDA Project**! In this assignment, you will perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a road traffic accident dataset.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains information about road traffic accidents in Addis Ababa from 2017 to 2020. It includes **32 features** and **12,316 instances**. Your task is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights.

- **RTA Dataset.csv**: The raw dataset.
- **cleaned.csv**: Preprocessed and cleaned dataset (to be created by you).

---

## **EDA Tasks**

### 1. Problem Statement

### 2. Load and Inspect the Data

### 3. Descriptive Statistics

### 4. Clean the Data

### 5. Visualize the Data

### 6. Feature Engineering

### 7. Handling the Outliers 

### 8. Handling Class Imbalance

### 9. Insights and Patterns
  - Derive actionable insights from the data, such as:
  - Common causes of accidents.
  - High-risk times, locations, or conditions.
  - Relationships that could assist in prediction.
    
### 10. Save and Document
  - Save the cleaned dataset as `cleaned.csv`.
  - Document all steps clearly in a report or notebook.

## **Steps to Use GitHub**

### **1. Fork the Repository**
- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the repository page to create your own copy.

### **2. Clone the Repository**
- Clone the repository to your local machine using:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/EDA-Road-Traffic-Accidents.git
  ```
- Navigate into the cloned directory:
  ```bash
  cd EDA-Road-Traffic-Accidents
  ```

### **3. Create a New Branch**
- Create and switch to a new branch for your changes:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b eda-cleaning
  ```

### **4. Make Changes**
- Add your code or files for the task (e.g., cleaning the data or EDA analysis).

### **5. Stage Changes**
- Check the status of the repository:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
- Stage all modified files:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
- Or stage specific files:
  ```bash
  git add filename
  ```

### **6. Commit Changes**
- Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Added data cleaning scripts"
  ```

### **7. Push Changes**
- Push your branch to your GitHub repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin eda-cleaning
  ```

### **8. Create a Pull Request**
- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click the **Compare & pull request** button for your branch.
- Add a descriptive title and summary for your pull request.
- Submit the pull request for review.

## **Tips for Success**
1. **Comment Your Code:** Explain what each section of code does to improve readability.
2. **Structure:** Keep your project organized, e.g., separate directories for raw data, processed data, and scripts.
3. **Documentation:** Document findings and methods in a markdown file or report.
4. **Commit Often:** Make small, incremental commits with meaningful messages.
